# 🧱 Backlog Features 
Implement Product Detail Data Fetching Logic

## 🎯 Objective
Build the core logic to fetch and render a single product’s detailed information on the Product Detail Page (PDP), including images, prices, and variants.

## 🧩 Description
This backlog focuses on:
- Setting up GraphQL queries to retrieve product data by ID or slug.
- Handling loading and error states in the PDP.
- Normalizing response data for Redux storage.
- Ensuring the PDP layout adapts dynamically based on product type.

## 🧾 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PDP displays correct product data from MongoDB.
- [ ] GraphQL query returns full product structure (name, price, variants, images).
- [ ] Redux state updates after each fetch.
- [ ] Error and loading skeletons handled properly.
- [ ] Code covered by at least 80% unit tests.

## 🧠 Helpful Notes
- Use existing `productList` state logic for consistency.
- Consider integrating caching for better performance.
- Use centralized error handler middleware from Redux Toolkit.
