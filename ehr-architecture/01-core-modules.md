# Core Modules for a General-Purpose EHR

This document outlines the essential modules for a general-purpose Electronic Health Record (EHR) system designed for small clinics, with a focus on patient records and billing.

## 1. Patient Management

Handles all administrative aspects of patient information.

- **Patient Registration and Demographics:** Capturing and managing patient personal information (name, DOB, address, contact info).
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Booking, rescheduling, and canceling patient appointments. Includes calendar views for providers.
- **Insurance Information Management:** Storing and verifying patient insurance details.

## 2. Clinical Records

Manages all clinical data related to patient care.

- **Vitals and Chief Complaints:** Recording patient's vital signs and the primary reason for their visit.
- **Medical History:** Maintaining a comprehensive history of allergies, current medications, and past medical problems.
- **Clinical Notes (SOAP Notes):** A structured format for clinicians to document patient encounters (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan).
- **E-Prescribing (eRx):** Electronically sending prescriptions to pharmacies.
- **Lab and Imaging Orders/Results:** Creating orders for laboratory tests and imaging studies, and receiving and storing the results.

## 3. Billing and Invoicing

Manages the financial aspects of the clinic.

- **Service Code Management:** Using standard codes for medical procedures and diagnoses (e.g., CPT, ICD-10).
- **Claim Generation and Submission:** Creating and electronically submitting insurance claims.
- **Patient Invoicing and Payment Processing:** Generating invoices for patients and processing payments.

## 4. User Management and Security

Ensures the system is secure and that users only have access to the information they need.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Defining different roles (e.g., doctor, nurse, receptionist, administrator) with specific permissions.
- **Audit Trails:** Logging all access and changes to patient data for security and compliance purposes.

## 5. Reporting and Analytics

Provides insights into the clinic's operations.

- **Basic Reports:** Generating reports on patient demographics, appointment statistics, and billing information.
