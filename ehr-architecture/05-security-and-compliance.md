# Security and HIPAA Compliance Strategy

This document outlines the key security measures and a strategy for maintaining HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance for the EHR application.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that Protected Health Information (PHI) is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
- **Integrity:** Maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of PHI over its entire lifecycle.
- **Availability:** Ensuring that PHI is accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized person.

## 2. Technical Safeguards

- **Access Control:**
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** As mentioned in the core modules, users will be assigned roles with the minimum necessary permissions to perform their jobs.
  - **Unique User Identification:** Every user must have a unique username and password. Shared accounts are not permitted.
- **Encryption:**
  - **Data in Transit:** All data transmitted between the client, server, and external services will be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
  - **Data at Rest:** All PHI stored in the database will be encrypted. Most cloud database services (like AWS RDS) provide this feature.
- **Audit Controls:**
  - **Audit Trails:** The system will log all access, creation, modification, and deletion of PHI. These logs will be regularly reviewed.
- **Authentication:**
  - **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, history).
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Highly recommended for all users, especially those with high levels of access.
- **Data Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
  - Regular, automated backups of the database.
  - A documented disaster recovery plan to restore service in case of an emergency.

## 3. Administrative Safeguards

- **Security Management Process:**
  - **Risk Analysis:** Conduct a regular risk analysis to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to PHI.
  - **Risk Management:** Implement security measures to mitigate identified risks.
- **Security Personnel:** Designate a security official who is responsible for the development and implementation of the policies and procedures required by HIPAA.
- **Information Access Management:** Develop policies and procedures for authorizing access to PHI.
- **Workforce Training and Management:**
  - All workforce members with access to PHI must receive training on HIPAA policies and procedures.
  - Implement sanctions for workforce members who fail to comply.
- **Evaluation:** Periodically evaluate the security policies and procedures to ensure they are effective.

## 4. Physical Safeguards

- **Facility Access Controls:** If hosting on-premise, implement policies and procedures to limit physical access to electronic information systems and the facility in which they are housed.
- **Cloud Hosting:** When using a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure), they are responsible for the physical security of the data centers. It is crucial to sign a **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** with the cloud provider.

## 5. Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

- A BAA is a written contract between a covered entity and a business associate. It is required by law for HIPAA compliance.
- Any third-party service that handles PHI (e.g., cloud provider, email service, payment gateway) must sign a BAA.
