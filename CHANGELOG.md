## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-13

### v0.5 — Workforce Semantics

- **Skill catalog & matching:** `SkillStore` (`.SprintDesk/workforce/skills.yml`) with 8 seeded skills, aliases, and a default task-type → skill mapping; deterministic `capabilityService.rankEmployees` ranking (coverage → load → status → name → id) for LLM-free assignee selection.
- **RBAC policy:** `PolicyStore` (`.SprintDesk/workforce/policy.yml`) with role → permission matrix (`lead/developer/reviewer/observer/agent/human`) and per-employee allow/deny overrides.
- **Lifecycle gates:** enforced permissions on `sprintdesk_tasksAssign`, `sprintdesk_tasksClaim`, and `sprintdesk_runsCreate`; offline employees excluded from ranking work.
- **New MCP tools (40 → 44):** `sprintdesk_skillsList`, `sprintdesk_skillsUpsert`, `sprintdesk_policyGet`, `sprintdesk_recommendEmployees`.
- **UI hooks:** `SprintDesk: Recommend Assignee` on tasks, catalog-based skill picker in Add Employee, skills + permissions in workforce tooltips.
- **Standup:** "Matching Readiness" section (catalog size, full/partial/uncovered open tasks, aggregate skill gaps).
- Contract documented in `docs/v0.5-workforce-contract.md`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-13

### Foundation (M1-M6)

- **Workforce (M5):** Employee/team model with YAML persistence under `.SprintDesk/workforce/`, workforce sidebar tree (teams, members with human/agent kind, status, skills), commands (Add Employee, Create Team, Assign to Team, Sync Workforce from Team), and dangling-lead cleanup on reassignment.
- **MCP servers (M6):** HTTP and stdio transports with shared tool core, expanded `sprintdesk_*` toolset (40 tools), auto-managed `.SprintDesk/project.mcp.json`, and headless CLI entry points (`npm run mcp`, `npm run standup`).
- **Data & persistence (M1/M2):** YAML store layer, migration service, audit/event/history tracking, run records.
- Settings, history service, and interactive command plumbing.
